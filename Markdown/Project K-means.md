# K-Means Clustering: A Beginner's Tutorial

## Introduction

K-means clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It is used to partition a dataset into `k` distinct clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). This tutorial will walk you through the mathematical foundation, general workflow, and a Python implementation of the k-means algorithm without using advanced libraries.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Objective

The goal of k-means is to minimize the within-cluster variance, which is the sum of squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster. The objective function is defined as:

$$
J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2
$$

where:
- $k$ is the number of clusters.
- $C_i$ is the set of points in cluster $i$.
- $\mu_i$ is the centroid (mean) of cluster $i$.
- $\|x - \mu_i\|^2$ is the squared Euclidean distance between point $x$ and centroid $\mu_i$.

### The Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Select $k$ initial centroids randomly from the dataset.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update**: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.
4. **Convergence**: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly.

## General Workflow

1. **Choose the Number of Clusters ($k$)**:
   - Determine the number of clusters you want the algorithm to find in the dataset.

2. **Initialize the Centroids**:
   - Randomly select $k$ data points as the initial centroids.

3. **Assign Data Points to Nearest Centroid**:
   - Calculate the distance between each data point and each centroid.
   - Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

4. **Update Centroids**:
   - Recalculate the centroids by computing the mean of all data points in each cluster.

5. **Repeat Until Convergence**:
   - Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize.

## Project description
In this project, you will apply the k-means algorithm to an image to identify the most prominent colors (clusters) within it. The RGB values of each pixel will be treated as data points in a three-dimensional space. After clustering the pixels using K-means, the resulting colors will be sorted from light to dark based on their luminance.

### How to Compute Lightness and Darkness of a Color

When working with colors, especially in tasks like image processing or design, it's often useful to determine whether a color is "light" or "dark." This can be computed using the RGB values of the color.

### Understanding RGB Values

Every color on a digital screen is composed of three components: Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). Each of these components typically has a value between 0 and 255.

- **Red (R)**: Intensity of the red component
- **Green (G)**: Intensity of the green component
- **Blue (B)**: Intensity of the blue component

The combination of these three components determines the final color.

### Calculating Luminance

One common way to compute the "lightness" or "darkness" of a color is by calculating its luminance. Luminance is a weighted sum of the RGB components, reflecting the human eye's sensitivity to these colors.

### Luminance Formula

The standard formula for calculating luminance is:

$$
\text{Luminance} = 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B
$$


### Why These Weights?

- **Red (R)**: The human eye is more sensitive to green light than red or blue. That's why green has the highest weight in this formula.
- **Green (G)**: Green contributes the most to luminance due to its high sensitivity to the human eye.
- **Blue (B)**: Blue contributes the least to luminance, as the human eye is less sensitive to blue light.

### Interpretation of Luminance

- **Higher Luminance Values**: Indicate that the color is lighter.
- **Lower Luminance Values**: Indicate that the color is darker.

### Example Calculation

Letâ€™s say you have a color with the following RGB values:

- R = 50
- G = 100
- B = 150

The luminance of this color would be calculated as:

$$
\text{Luminance} = 0.299 * 50 + 0.587 * 100 + 0.114 * 150 = 14.95 + 58.7 + 17.1 = 90.75
$$

With a luminance of 90.75, this color would be considered relatively dark, especially compared to the maximum possible luminance of 255.

### Project Objective
Your task is to implement the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch, without using advanced machine learning libraries. The algorithm should:

- Read an image and extract the RGB values of each pixel.
- Perform k-means clustering on the RGB values to identify the dominant colors in the image.
- Sort the resulting colors from light to dark using their luminance values.
- Generate and display an output image that includes the original image and rectangles representing the sorted colors.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this task, you will gain a deeper understanding of how clustering algorithms work and how they can be applied to real-world data, such as images. You will also learn how to manipulate and analyze color data in Python, providing a foundation for more advanced image processing techniques.

## Python Implementation

Here is a simple implementation of k-means clustering in Python, without using advanced libraries like scikit-learn or OpenCV.

make sure you have install `pillow` package
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pillow
```

Please use this code as a reference, **program independently first**, and then compare it to this example

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Read the input image using PIL and ensure it's in RGB mode
input_image_path = 'img.png'  # Replace with your image path
image = Image.open(input_image_path)

# Convert the image to RGB if it's not already in that mode
if image.mode != 'RGB':
    image = image.convert('RGB')

image_rgb = np.array(image)

# Step 2: Reshape the image to a 2D array of pixels (RGB values)
pixels = image_rgb.reshape((-1, 3))

# Step 3: Initialize k random centroids
def initialize_centroids(pixels, k):
    random_indices = random.sample(range(len(pixels)), k)
    centroids = pixels[random_indices]
    return centroids

# Step 4: Assign each pixel to the nearest centroid
def assign_pixels_to_centroids(pixels, centroids):
    assignments = []
    for pixel in pixels:
        distances = np.linalg.norm(pixel - centroids, axis=1)
        nearest_centroid = np.argmin(distances)
        assignments.append(nearest_centroid)
    return np.array(assignments)

# Step 5: Update the centroids by calculating the mean of assigned pixels
def update_centroids(pixels, assignments, k):
    new_centroids = []
    for i in range(k):
        assigned_pixels = pixels[assignments == i]
        if len(assigned_pixels) == 0:  # Avoid division by zero
            new_centroid = pixels[random.randint(0, len(pixels)-1)]
        else:
            new_centroid = np.mean(assigned_pixels, axis=0)
        new_centroids.append(new_centroid)
    return np.array(new_centroids)

# Step 6: Perform the k-means clustering
def kmeans(pixels, k, max_iterations=100):
    centroids = initialize_centroids(pixels, k)
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        assignments = assign_pixels_to_centroids(pixels, centroids)
        new_centroids = update_centroids(pixels, assignments, k)
        if np.allclose(centroids, new_centroids):
            break
        centroids = new_centroids
    return centroids, assignments

# Step 7: Run the k-means algorithm
k = 5  # Number of clusters (feature colors)
centroids, assignments = kmeans(pixels, k)

# Step 8: Sort the centroids (colors) from light to dark
def luminance(color):
    # Calculate luminance using the formula: 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B
    return 0.299 * color[0] + 0.587 * color[1] + 0.114 * color[2]

# Sort centroids by luminance
sorted_centroids = sorted(centroids, key=luminance)

# Convert sorted centroids back to a NumPy array
sorted_centroids = np.array(sorted_centroids)

# Step 9: Create a new image with the original image and sorted feature color rectangles
height, width, _ = image_rgb.shape
rect_height = 50
output_image = np.zeros((height + rect_height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
output_image[:height, :, :] = image_rgb

# Draw rectangles with sorted feature colors
for i, color in enumerate(sorted_centroids.astype(int)):
    start_x = int(i * width / k)
    end_x = int((i + 1) * width / k)
    output_image[height:, start_x:end_x, :] = color

# Step 10: Save and display the output image
output_image = Image.fromarray(output_image.astype('uint8'))
output_image.save('output_image_sorted.jpg')

# Display the output image using matplotlib
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.imshow(output_image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

# Print the RGB values of the sorted feature colors
print("Sorted feature colors (RGB) from light to dark:")
for i, color in enumerate(sorted_centroids.astype(int)):
    print(f"Color {i + 1}: {color}")
```
