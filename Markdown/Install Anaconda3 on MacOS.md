## Step 3: Verify Installation

To verify that Anaconda was installed correctly, you can use the terminal:

1. Open the Terminal application (you can find it in the `Applications/Utilities` folder or search for it using Spotlight).
2. You should see (base) in the command line prompt. This tells you that youâ€™re in your base conda environment.
3. Type `conda list`. This command lists all the packages installed in the Anaconda environment. If Anaconda is installed correctly, you should see a list of installed packages.

## Step 4: Deactivate the base environment by default

1. In Terminal, use the following line to prevent Anaconda from activating the base environment on startup

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```
2. restart the Terminal, (base) in the command line prompt should gone.
